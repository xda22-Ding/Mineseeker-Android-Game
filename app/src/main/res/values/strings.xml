    <string name="game_info">
        The goal of this game is to find all the hidden mines inside the slots.\n
        Clicking one slot will reveal:
        \n\t1. a mine! if the slot contains a mine;
        \n\t2. a number! if the slot is not a mine.
        The number indicates the remaining mines in the same row and column of the slot.
        \nIf a mine is revealed, clicking the mine again will reveal the number of remaining
        mines int he same row and column as well.
        \nWhat a nice useless boring application that really shapes and trains our skills!</string>
